==Biography==
Bazz is the captain of the guard of {{Term|BotW|Zora's Domain|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks to that, I made great progress with my sword training, and now I am captain of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Zora's Domain}} guard!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He wields a [[Silverscale Spear]]. When he was a child, he was the leader of the Big Bad Bazz Brigade, which included himself, [[Rivan]], [[Gaddison]], and {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|The leader of the pack, Bazz... The heroine, Gaddison...|Rivan|BotW}}</ref> Link taught Bazz swordsmanship when he was young.<ref>{{Cite|A hundred years ago, you frequently trained me in the art of the blade. Remember?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>

While Bazz does find Link to be familiar at first, he has trouble placing where they've met before.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Gray|That said, this Hylian... I get the feeling I've seen him before... Perhaps a long time ago...}}|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> When he does finally recognize Link, he decides to test him with the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password to make sure he's correct.<ref>{{Cite|I must ask something of you, traveler. If you know it, speak it now. What is the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He starts with, "Fluffy white clouds! Clear blue..." After Link successfully guesses the word "Zora", Bazz will be convinced that the person he's speaking to is Link.<ref>{{Cite|Yes! There is no mistaking it! You are, indeed, the real Master Link!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He asks Link what he's been doing for the past 100 years, but doesn't believe Link when he reveals he was sleeping.<ref>{{Cite|That said, you haven't changed at all... But what have you been doing for the last 100 years?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|As though you could sleep for that long. Hmph.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>

After the [[Divine Beast Vah Ruta (Quest)|Divine Beast Vah Ruta]]" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}} has been completed, he thanks Link for doing so.<ref>{{Cite|Master Link! Thank you!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> While he believes that calming [[Divine Beast Vah Ruta]] should have been his job as the captain of the guard, he's unable to handle {{Plural|BotW|Shock Arrow|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|As captain of the guard, that should've been my responsibility. But {{Color|BotW Blue|shock arrows}} are the one thing I just can't handle.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> However, even though the trouble has passed, he still plans on protecting Zora's Domain.<ref>{{Cite|Even though {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}} has been appeased, I must not let my guard down... I must continue to serve and defend this domain as I always have!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He can also be seen in the {{Term|BotW|Throne Room|link}} as [[King Dorephan]] thanks Link.
