{{Term/Store|Decayed Guardian|Decayed Guardians|Series, BotW|plural}} are enemies in {{BotW}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Decayed Guardian}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
{{Compendium/Extract|Decayed Guardian}}
Decayed Guardians are decayed variations of the [[Guardian Stalker]]s that have long lost their mobility. They are found buried in the ground, unable to move due to having no legs. Decayed Guardians appear inactive until {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} approaches it, when they light up and aim their laser sights at Link in preparation to fire.<ref>{{Cite|Approach with caution; some of these derelict models have been known to awaken from stasis and attack when approached.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> A massive amount of Decayed Guardians can be found in the [[Forgotten Temple]] and will simultaneously take aim at Link the moment he enters the temple. They are prone to malfunctioning after being attacked, firing off several lasers in rapid succession.

If Link performs a [[Perfect Guard]] with any [[Shields in Breath of the Wild|Shield]] on its laser, it is instantly defeated. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} hits a Decayed Guardian in its eye using a bow, it will temporarily stun it. Using [[Stasis|Stasis +]] on a charging up Decayed Guardian will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during stasis.

In [[Master Mode]], Decayed Guardians will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off Link's timing.

===Drops===
A Decayed Guardian drops between 4 and 6 of:
{{BotWDropTable | Ancient Screw | 40 | Ancient Spring | 25 | Ancient Gear | 20 | Ancient Shaft | 15 }}
