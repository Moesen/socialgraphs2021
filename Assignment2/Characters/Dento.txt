==Biography==
Dento can be found at his workshop, the [[Hammerhead]], in [[Marot Mart]] in {{Term|BotW|Zora's Domain|link}}. He is the one who repaired [[Mipha]]'s [[Lightscale Trident]]. <ref>{{Cite|He's the one who fixed Mipha's weapon, the {{Color|BotW Blue|Lightscale Trident}}|Marot|BotW}}</ref>

Like all elder Zora, Dento is initially hostile and untrusting towards {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} due to the loss of Mipha. After [[Divine Beast Vah Ruta]] is calmed and Link receives the Lightscale Trident, Dento will offer to repair it should it ever break, in exchange for a [[Zora Spear]], a [[Diamond]], and five pieces of [[Flint]].<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Blue|Lightscale Trident}}...
