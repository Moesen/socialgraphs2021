Deltan complains about a man who told her that he is engaged but claims that she cannot be angry about it.<ref>{{Cite|"I'm engaged." *sigh* I can't even be angry at that one...|Deltan|BotW}}</ref> She also complains about a man who told her that he likes to cook after she took [[Ashai]]'s cooking class,<ref>{{Cite|"I like to be the one to do the cooking."
