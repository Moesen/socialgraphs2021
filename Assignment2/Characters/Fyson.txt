She asks me to help out at the store every single day. I can't take it anymore... I don't...want to just "help." I want to open my OWN store and sell whatever I want!|Fyson|BotW}}</ref> However, he does not want to compete with his mother's shop, so he is found searching for a new place to open it.<ref>{{Cite|But I don't want to compete with Mom.
