==Biography==
Dugby is a [[Goron]] child who resides at the [[Goron Hot Springs]] in the [[Eldin Canyon]]. During the day, he can found sitting in one of its [[Hot Spring]]s. At night, he is  asleep.

Dugby gives the [[Side Quest]] "[[Death Mountain's Secret]]", in which he challenges Link to find the treasure that he buried near the [[Bridge of Eldin]], with the promise that Link can keep it if he finds it.<ref>{{Cite|I bid a {{Color|BotW Red|tweshure}} binteen gear an ba {{Color|BotW Blue|Bridge of Eldin}}! Iz an abazing schtick! Beely bool! If boo bind it... iz boars!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> However, because Dugby's mouth is submerged underwater when spoken to, his directions to the treasure come out as gurgles.<ref>{{Cite|Bello! Goo gon't go but I'm thaying?|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> If visited during the night, Dugby mutters in his sleep clearer directions to the treasure.<ref>{{Cite|<small><nowiki>*snore*</nowiki> The {{Color|BotW Red|treasure}}...at the {{Color|BotW Red|top of a lava waterfall}}...</small>|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> The treasure turns out to be a [[Drillshaft]]. Although amazed that Link found the treasure, Dugby is skeptic about it and checks the Weapon to determine if it is the same Drillshaft he buried,<ref>{{Cite|Hey! Don't tell me that stick is... [...] That's the {{Color|BotW Blue|drillshaft}} I hid! ...Right? Actually, I need to get a better look at it. Show it me! NOW!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> and confirms that it is the same one.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I guess so. It's suspicious though! I can't help thinkin' that's the {{Color|BotW Blue|drillshaft}} I hid... <small>There's no mistakin' it... There was definitely a big noise... Could this person be...</small> Mmhmmm... So you went and found the {{Color|BotW Blue|drillshaft}} I hid.|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> True to his word, he lets Link keep the Drillshaft as a reward for finding it.
