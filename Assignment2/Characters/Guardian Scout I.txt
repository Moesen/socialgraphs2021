Guardian Scout I can be found in [[Ancient Shrine|shrines]] that involve fighting. While other Guardians were made to combat [[Calamity Ganon]], [[Guardian Scout]]s were made specifically for [[Ancient Shrine]]s.<ref>{{Cite|Guardians were originally designed by an ancient civilization to combat Ganon, but these smaller models were placed inside shrines as part of the trials found within.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> They are the weakest of all the Guardian Scout, and have no ancient weaponry at their disposal. They only use lasers to fight. These types of [[Guardian|Guardians]] can be found in the [[Oman Au Shrine]], the [[Keh Namut Shrine]], and other {{Plural|Series|Shrine of Trials|link}}. Though they remain uncorrupted in Ancient Shrines, their corrupted versions can be found inside [[Divine Beasts]].
