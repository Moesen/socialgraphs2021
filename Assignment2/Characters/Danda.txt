==Biography==
Danda is an elderly [[Gerudo]] who manages an [[Arrow Specialty Shop]] in [[Gerudo Town]].<ref>{{Cite|Sav'aaq... Are you a traveler from abroad? A Hylian tourist? As you can see, this is an {{Color|BotW Blue|arrow specialty shop}}.|Danda|BotW}}</ref> She boasts that she has the best selection of [[Arrow]]s available.<ref>{{Cite|You won't see a selection like this anywhere else.|Danda|BotW}}</ref> Danda also mentions that she has to look after her daughter's children, meaning that the two children that sleep at her shop at night, {{Term|BotW|Kalani|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Makure|link}}, are her grandchildren.<ref name="Daughter">{{Cite|My daughter really isn't that much older than you, and she works nonstop from dawn until dusk. Which means it's my responsibility to look after her children for her...|Danda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's dark out now, so I'm going back to my vaba's booth!|Makure|BotW}}</ref>

If {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} purchases everything in her shop, {{Term|BotW|Danda}} will remark that sheâ€™s never seen her selection cleared out so completely, before thanking {{Term|BotW|Link}} and telling him that she thinks she should now be able to buy her grandchildren some new toys.<ref>{{Cite|For you to buy every last arrow like that, well... I don't think I've ever seen my selection cleared out so completely. But, thanks to you, I think I'll be able to buy my grandchildren some new toys.|Danda|BotW}}</ref>
