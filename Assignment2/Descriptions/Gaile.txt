At night, she can be found sitting in front of its Cooking Pot.\nWhen spoken to, Gaile asks Link if he is planning on heading to Goron City. She becomes concerned when she sees that he is not dressed for the climate, and warns him that it gets so hot past the Region\'s second checkpoint that he will catch on fire. She decides that she likes Link enough to sell him Fireproof Elixirs that will protect him from the hot climate, and recommends that he buy at least three.\nGaile will sell one Elixir for 60 Rupees, two for 110 Rupees, and three for 150 Rupees. When Link buys one Elixir, Gaile recites the saying "hope for the best, prepare for the worst." If Link buys two or three Elixirs, Gaile declares that he could make it to Goron City.\nIf Link refuses to buy any Elixirs, Gaile decides she will not waste her time and suggests he give up on Goron City. However, if Link is already dressed in at least one piece of the Fireproof Armor set, she states that he can make it.\n\n\n=== Wares and Pricing ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nHylian\nFoothill Stable\nOzunda\n\n\n== References =='
