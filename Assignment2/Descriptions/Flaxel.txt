b'Flaxel is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFlaxel is a Hylian traveler who is found in the Gerudo Canyon. She carries a Hunter\'s Shield and Traveler\'s Sword. She was previously traveling with her friends Sesami, Oliff, Flaxel, and Palme. However, the five of them were attacked by Bokoblins on the path to Koukot Plateau and ended up separated.\nAt Gerudo Canyon Stable, Link can find Sesami, who managed to escape. He asks Link to let Flaxel and the rest of his friends know that he\'s waiting for them at the Stable. This initiates the Side Quest "Missing in Action".\nFlaxel is found on the southeastern edge of the Koukot Plateau. When Link saves her from the Blue Bokoblin attacking her, she thanks him for his help. She remarks on how sore she\'ll be tomorrow, calling the Bokoblins filthy bottom-feeders. Flaxel is angry when she finds out Sesami has been at the Gerudo Canyon Stable the whole time, at which point she decides to give him a piece of her mind.\nBack at Gerudo Canyon Stable, Flaxel admits that she was going to yell at Sesami for leaving her, but she stopped once she saw his face. She can\'t bring herself to be mad at him for being scared, since that\'s the way he is.\nFlaxel and the rest of her friends chip in to give Link a Gold Rupee as thanks for saving them. After the Quest is complete, Flaxel and her friends, with the exception of Sesami, disappear from the Stable, as they\'ve all decided to part ways.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nFlaxel is named after Flaxseed oil.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nHylian\nGerudo Canyon\nGerudo Canyon Stable\n"Missing in Action"\nCanolo\nOliff\nPalme\nSesami\n\n\n== References =='
