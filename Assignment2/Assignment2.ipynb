This seemed to make the exercises and explanations a little incoherrent, so we have included the code for the API-calls and other misc stuff. We have tried to collapse the cell blocks, so this is not annoying for the reader, but if they do appear, sorry for the inconvinience."

As whether the keyword is `race` or `species` is not important `(?:)` is used, to make the capture group not return anything.
