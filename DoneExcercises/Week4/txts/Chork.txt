If Link speaks to him there, he mentions an altar at [[Washa's Bluff]], south of the [[Stable]].<ref>{{Cite|Oooh, I don't have time to be drinkin' right now... You stayin' here at our stable? That's nice, but check this out. Go way out south of here, and you'll find a flat hill called {{Color|BotW Blue|Washa's Bluff}}. On that hill, there's this mysterious-lookin' platform thingie... Me and Geggle tried all day to figure out what it does, but we're stumped...|Chork|BotW}}</ref> If spoken to again, he will tell Link that [[Kass]] flew to Washa's Bluff to observe it himself.<ref>{{Cite|If you want to see the platform thingie, go south toward {{Color|BotW Blue|Washa's Bluff}}. There was this one...{{Color|BotW Blue|Rito}} guy that went flying to the south after I told him about it. He was a big ol' bard with some fancy instrument thingie. He probably wanted to see the altar thingie himself.|Chork|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
