He explains to Link that the mushroom on his head suddenly sprouted that day, so he had expected something to happen (referring to Link\'s arrival to Korok Forest).<ref>{{Cite|The mushroom on my head suddenly sprouted today, so I knew something was up!

He is also the only korok aside from Hestu to have a unique character design not shared with any other korok in the game.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Koroks\n |characters= BotW\n}}'
