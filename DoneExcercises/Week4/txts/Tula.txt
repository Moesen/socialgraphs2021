La la laaa!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> She will call to Link and remark that he is a [[Hylian]].<ref>{{Cite|Ah! You there! Over here! Over heeere!! I knew it! You are a Hylian, aren\'t you?! Yes, you must be a Hylian! Otherwise, you\'re one unfortunate-looking Zora!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> She exclaims that his timing is perfect,<ref>{{Cite|Well, your timing couldn\'t be more perfect if you tried!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> since she has been ordered by [[Sidon]] to find a Hylian.<ref>{{Cite|I was ordered by {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} to find a Hylian!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> She says that she has been searching nonstop,<ref>{{Cite|I\'ve been searching nonstop! Yes, quite!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> and was not floating and splashing in the water for fun.<ref>{{Cite|I certainly wasn\'t just floating around and splashing in the water for fun!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Tula will turn and point at a [[Sheikah Tower]], and tell Link that Sidon is waiting at Inogo Bridge on the other side.<ref>{{Cite|... He\'s waiting at {{Color|BotW Blue|Inogo Bridge}}, which is on the other side of that tall tower.|Tula|BotW}}</ref> She expresses hope that Link will go and meet the [[Zora]] prince,<ref>{{Cite|I do hope you\'ll agree to go there and meet with him...|Tula|BotW}}</ref> but realizes he is probably taken aback by such a sudden request.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, yes... You must be taken aback by such a sudden request.|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Apologizing, she explains that for the Zora, this is their top priority at the moment.<ref>{{Cite|My apologies. For us Zora, this is our top priority right now.|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Tula asks for Link to grant her request,<ref>{{Cite|So I must beg you to grant my request...|Tula|BotW}}</ref> and tells the hero not to let Sidon know she was splashing and playing in the water.<ref>{{Cite|... Oh. and... if you do meet {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}}... Perhaps don\'t tell him I was splashing about playing in the water. Deal?|Tula|BotW}}</ref>\n\nTula is the president of Prince Sidon\'s fan club.<ref>{{Cite|I am the president of Prince Sidon\'s fan club. My name is Tula.|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Thinking of Sidon "turns her to mush," though she expresses great distaste towards the Zora elders calling them a pack of geezers.<ref>{{Cite|Ahhh... Mmm... Prince Sidon... Just thinking of you turns me to mush... On the other hand, if that pack of geezers show up again, I swear...|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Tula apologizes and encourages Link to speak with the prince, who she says is a man with magnificent ideas.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I\'m sorry... *ahem* Anyway, Prince Sidon is a man with magnificent ideas. Oh, I know! Why don\'t you go and have a chat with Prince Sidon? Yes, do!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> After Link appeases the Divine Beast, Tula can be seen running around Zora\'s Domain. When stopped she tells Link he is in her way and asks if he needs something.<ref>{{Cite|Yes? <small>{{Color|BotW Gray|You\'re...in my way...}}</small>|Tula|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the "pack of geezers," Tula says the Zora elders intend to stop Divine Beast Vah Ruta without any outside help, even though it is impossible for the Zora to touch [[Shock Arrow]]s for an extended period of time.<ref>{{Cite|The Zora elders intend for our people to stop {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}} without any outside help. <small>Even though touching {{Color|BotW Blue|shock arrows}} for an extended period of time is impossible for us.</small>|Tula|BotW}}</ref> However, Prince Sidon had the idea to ask an outsider to shoot the shock arrows for them.<ref>{{Cite|Prince Sidon, on the other hand, had the idea that we could ask an outsider to shoot the {{Color|BotW Blue|shock arrows}} for us!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Tula says Sidon has such bold ideas.<ref>{{Cite|That\'s our Prince Sidon for you.. He has such bold ideas!|Tula|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about Vah Ruta, Tula says that she means Divine Beast Vah Ruta in [[East Reservoir Lake]].<ref>{{Cite|By {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}}, I mean {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Ruta}} in {{Color|BotW Blue|East Reservoir Lake}}.|Tula|BotW}}</ref> Tula brings up that the bad weather seems to have calmed down, wondering if Sidon has finally appeased the Divine Beast.<ref>{{Cite|Speaking of which... The bad weather seems to have calmed down a bit lately. Is it possible...that Prince Sidon finally appeased {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}}?|Tula|BotW}}</ref> \n\nAfter [[Waterblight Ganon]] is defeated, Tula and the other Zora watch as [[King Dorephan]] gives Link his thanks.<ref>{{Cite|Link, all of the Zora thank you from the depths of our hearts for your heroic and selfless work!|King Dorephan|BotW}}</ref> She cheers with the other Zora after Sidon thanks the hero as well.<ref>{{Cite|Link!
