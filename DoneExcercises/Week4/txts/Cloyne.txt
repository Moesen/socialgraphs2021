He runs the [[All or Nothing]] game where visitors bet 10, 50, or 100 [[Rupees]] and then open one of three [[Treasure Chests]]. If they open the right chest, they'll receive more Rupees than they bet. If they open one of the other two chests, they'll only receive 1 Rupee.<ref>{{Cite|See those treasure chests over there? Whaddaya say to a little wager on 'em? The idea is you pick any chest you want and open it. Simple, right? The best part is whatever chest you open, you get all the money inside. Course, only one chest is worth opening, heh heh. Don't come crying to me if you pick wrong.|Mina|BotW}}</ref>\n\n[[Armes]], another resident of Lurelin Village, mentions that he goes to Cloyne's shop when it's raining.<ref>{{Cite|Rain, huh...
