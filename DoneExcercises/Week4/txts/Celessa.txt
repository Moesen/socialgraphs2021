Though, to be frank, mine is more of a pilgrimage. I do hope that Princess Zelda's devout prayers for peace will touch the lives of others as they have touched mine.|Celessa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I do not know the purpose of your journey, but...there is a place that I recommend you pay a visit to. Deep in the recesses of Mount Lanayru lies the {{Color|BotW Blue|Spring of Wisdom}}... It is a storied spring to which I am making a pilgrimage.|Celessa|BotW}}</ref> She can be found at [[Fort Hateno]], where she will explain to [[Link]] that an ancient battle once took place there,<ref>{{Cite|This area was once the site of an ancient battle... Unlike other well-known ruins, I don't think imagining what took place here would be very satisfying. The reason I say that is because none of the old stories about the Great Calamity mention it being entirely defeated...|Celessa|BotW}}</ref> referring to the events of the [[Great Calamity]]. She laments the tragic battle where many [[Hyrule]]an Soldiers lost their lives protecting [[Hateno Village]] from the onslaught of [[Guardian Stalker|Guardian]]s and wishes to honor their sacrifice.<ref>{{Cite|An ancient battle took place here... Even just being near a place so full of tragic memories is painful. All we can do...is honor the brave lives that were lost here...|Celessa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link saves Celessa from monsters, she will thank him and give him [[Mighty Meaty Rice Balls]] as thanks.<ref>{{Cite|Thank you! Really, I can't believe you did that for me! Here. This is a small token of my thanks.|Celessa|BotW}}</ref> Celessa carries an [[Emblazoned Shield]] on her back.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
